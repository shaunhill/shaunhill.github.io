Corporate Experience

2014 - Present : _BI Developer/Consultant, Free-lance shaundh.co.za
(Gauteng, South Africa)_

  Requirements gathering, design and, implementation of business
  intelligence solutions which are both functional and practical. I have
  a diverse understanding of a variety of technologies while maintaining
  an in-depth knowledge of technologies in which I specialize. This
  gives me a perspective that allows me to take into account
  pre-existing, current and potential investments, and integrate these
  considerations into the solution.

2012 - 2014 : _BI Developer, MCC Group (Midrand, Gauteng, South Africa)_

  Being involved in all aspects of the EDW model, I had the opportunity
  to gain a wide range of BI and data related skills. Successfully
  designing, implementing and supporting both Microsoft SQL and SAP BW
  data warehouses. As well as implementing and supporting reporting and
  analytical developments in SAP Business Objects, Qlikview, and SSRS. I
  also assisted in other date related task, e.g. using LSMW and BAPIs to
  do data take on, and master data generation.

2010-2012 : _Database / Systems Administrator, MCC Group (Midrand,
Gauteng, South Africa)._

  Responsible for the administration and maintenance of physical and
  virtual servers, network infrastructure, IT related procurement and
  supplier management. It was during this time that I gain my initial
  expositor into databases design. Prior to this, I wrote scripts to
  automate administration related task, this gives me the foundation to
  pick up T-SQL fairly quickly. As my knowledge grew I took over the
  responsibility for databases and application, and ultimately business
  intelligence.

2007-2010 : _Network Administrator, Eqstra Holdings (Meadowdale,

Core Skills

_Design / Modeling / Planning_

  Strong knowledge of database and data warehouse design principles.
  With experience on working on implementation and design teams, doing
  requirements gathering, gap analyse, development, consultancy, post
  implementation support and training.

_Data processing / ETL_

  A large portion of my experience was focused towards ETL, With it
  mostly split between T-SQL/SSIS, and more recently SAP BW. I’m a
  hacker at heart and have no problem coding.

_Programming_

  Python and Java are my main languages, python tends to fulfil most of
  my need. I have familiarity with various design patterns and
  programing paradigms. However, Most of programming work is focused
  towards data processing.

_Visualization / Reporting_

  Visualization and reporting are a major part of my skill sets. As with
  ETL most my experience is SAP Business Objects and Microsoft SSRS. I
  have also made extensive use of R GGplot library, and am currently
  learning D3.js which can be considered a lower-level visualization
  library. D3 has a hand in many visualization tool, e.g. SAP Design
  studio offers an SDK which allows for the integration of custom
  components.

_Data analyse / profiling_

  Understanding the relationships and limitations of data is an on going
  process through the life cycle of a data warehouse. It helps identify
  issues early on and minimize surprizes. It also bring to light use
  full relationships in data that can aid developers and clients better
  define their requirements and understand their goals. Depending on the
  limitation of the project, I use a combination of SQL, R, Excel and
  Excel add-ons like SAP AAOE for analyse and profiling.
